## Why?

This repository was developed to demonstrate how to do the following:
* Creating a simple web application for rendering a whole slide image in real time.
* Containerizing and deploying a web app for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
* Rapid inference using a pretrained AI model for tumour segmentation

To access the live demo, click on the `Hugging Face` badge above. Below is a snapshot of the current state of the demo app.
